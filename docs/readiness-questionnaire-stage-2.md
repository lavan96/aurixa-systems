# Stage 2 — Business Readiness Questionnaire

Implementation notes for `/questionnaire`, built to section 6, Appendix B and
sections 13, 14 and 17 of *Aurixa Systems Priority Access, Qualification &
Onboarding Operating Model v1.0*.

Stage 1 (`/contact`) is unchanged. Stage 3 scoring, the transactional email
sequence and the CRM routing in sections 7, 10 and 11 are not part of this
change.

## Visibility

The route exists but is unlisted. It is not in the Navbar, mobile menu, Footer,
any public page, any CTA or any sitemap (the site has no sitemap file), and the
page appends its own `robots: noindex, nofollow` meta on mount and removes it on
unmount so no other route's metadata changes. A browser check across `/`,
`/platform`, `/solutions`, `/industries`, `/about`, `/resources` and `/contact`
confirms no anchor references `/questionnaire`.

A `noindex` meta added by client-side JavaScript is weaker than a response
header. Serving `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow` for `/questionnaire` from the
hosting layer is recommended before launch.

## Question bank

Identifiers are stable; labels may be reworded. Questionnaire version:
`business-readiness-v1`.

| ID | Question | Control | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BRQ-01 | Role within the organisation | Dropdown, prefilled and correctable | Yes |
| BRQ-02 | Authority for technology purchases | Single select | Yes |
| BRQ-03 | People requiring access | Single select | Yes |
| BRQ-04 | Offices, entities or divisions | Single select | Yes |
| BRQ-05 | Operating locations (Australian states and territories) | Multi-select | Yes |
| BRQ-06 | Systems currently used | Multi-select + optional product names | Yes |
| BRQ-07 | Three biggest operational problems | Multi-select, max 3 | Yes |
| BRQ-08 | Weekly repetitive administration | Single select | Yes |
| BRQ-09 | Workflow causing the greatest difficulty | Textarea, 750 chars | No |
| BRQ-10 | Most relevant Aurixa capabilities | Ranked top five | Yes |
| BRQ-11 | Systems needing integration | Multi-select | Yes |
| BRQ-12 | Data migration | Single select + follow-ups | Yes |
| BRQ-13 | Implementation timing | Single select | Yes |
| BRQ-14 | Security, hosting, procurement requirements | Multi-select | Yes |
| BRQ-15 | Most useful next step | Single select | Yes |
| BRQ-16 | Indicative investment range | Single select, within 90 days only | No |

BRQ-01 reuses `ROLE_OPTIONS` from `src/lib/waitlist.ts` — there is no second
role list.

Conditional detail fields hang off their parent with a suffixed identifier
(`BRQ-01-OTHER`, `BRQ-11-PHONE-SYSTEM`, `BRQ-11-CUSTOM-NAME`, `BRQ-12-SOURCES`,
`BRQ-14-CONTEXT`, `BRQ-16-SPONSOR`, …). Optional product names use
`BRQ-06-PRODUCT:<system>`.

### Deviations from Appendix B

Requested by Aurixa after review of the live page:

- **BRQ-05 is Australian states and territories only.** New Zealand, Malaysia and
  "Other international markets" were removed, so the `BRQ-05-OTHER` follow-up has
  no trigger and was removed with them. BRQ-04 still offers "International or
  multi-jurisdiction organisation" if an applicant needs to signal offshore
  operations.
- **BRQ-10 "Voice automation" reads "AI Voice Agents & Call Logging"** — the
  Aurixa capability (inbound and outbound agents, lead follow-up, qualification,
  appointment scheduling, call logging, record updates and workflow actions)
  rather than the mechanism. Slug remains `voice_automation`.
- **BRQ-11 "Telephony" reads "Existing Phone or VoIP System"** and, when
  selected, asks "Which phone or VoIP system does your organisation currently
  use?" (`BRQ-11-PHONE-SYSTEM`, required, 160 chars). This keeps Aurixa Voice
  positioned as the product capability while the applicant's own phone system is
  only ever an integration target. Slug remains `telephony`.

Slugs are deliberately unchanged: labels may be reworded, identifiers must not
move. The questionnaire version stays `business-readiness-v1` because no response
has ever been stored — the first bump belongs to the first option change made
*after* responses start being persisted.

## Conditional logic (section 6.6)

`activeQuestionIds(answers)` is the single source of truth for what is on
screen. It drives rendering, validation, the review screen and the `active` flag
on every stored answer.

- Any "Other" selection requires an explanation.
- "No central system", "None initially", "Not yet known" and "None" are mutually
  exclusive with the named options in their group.
- Migration follow-ups appear for the five migration categories only.
- The phone-system follow-up appears only for "Existing Phone or VoIP System".
- Custom-integration follow-ups appear only for "Custom internal system".
- The security context field appears only when a named requirement is selected.
- More than 100 users, or multiple legal entities / national / international
  structure, reveals the three enterprise-readiness questions.
- Implementation within 90 days reveals BRQ-16 and the project-sponsor question;
  "Researching only", "3-6 months" and "6-12 months" suppress both.
- "No central system" reveals the information-management question.

**Nothing is deleted silently.** A conditional answer that stops being displayed
is retained in the draft and marked `active: false`, so changing a selection back
restores it, and inactive answers are never submitted as live responses. The one
case that genuinely discards answers — choosing a mutually exclusive option while
named options are selected — shows an inline confirmation first.

## Access

`/questionnaire` is reachable three ways, resolved in this order:

1. **A secure questionnaire token** in the link (`?t=…`) — prefill, draft resume
   and autosave. Requires the Supabase service below.
2. **The Stage 1 → Stage 2 handoff session** — the `aurixa_readiness_session`
   cookie issued the moment a Priority Access Application is accepted. Prefill,
   but no server-side draft store yet, so no autosave.
3. **The open-access escape hatch** — `VITE_QUESTIONNAIRE_OPEN_ACCESS="true"`.
   Off by default.

Anything else sees the locked screen. An already-completed questionnaire always
blocks: that is duplicate-submission protection, not access control.

### Stage 1 → Stage 2 handoff

    Stage 1 submitted
      → POST /api/priority-access/submit  (same origin)
        → server re-validates, forwards to the existing Make.com webhook
        → Make.com accepts
        → server seals a session and sets the cookie
      → PROCEED modal
      → user clicks PROCEED
      → /questionnaire  (GET /api/priority-access/session verifies the cookie)

The modal is shown only when Make.com has accepted **and** the session exists.
If either fails, the applicant sees the existing Stage 1 confirmation screen and
the questionnaire stays locked — nothing is lost, nothing is unlocked.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /api/priority-access/submit` | Re-validates Stage 1, forwards the unchanged payload to Make.com, issues the session cookie |
| `GET /api/priority-access/session` | Verifies the cookie, returns the verified Stage 1 details for prefill |
| `DELETE /api/priority-access/session` | Invalidates the session once Stage 2 is submitted |

The Stage 1 payload mapping is preserved *by construction*: the endpoint calls
the same `buildWaitlistPayload` the browser used, so Make.com → Airtable field
names, option slugs, attribution and consent values cannot drift. The existing
`X-Application-Id` idempotency header is forwarded unchanged.

### Session cookie

`aurixa_readiness_session` — HttpOnly, `SameSite=Strict`, `Path=/`, `Secure`
outside local http, and no `Max-Age`, so it is a browser-session cookie. The
verified Stage 1 details are sealed inside it with AES-256-GCM under
`READINESS_SESSION_SECRET`; the browser cannot read or forge it, and a two-hour
expiry inside the envelope bounds a cookie that is restored or copied.

There is no session table, so the handoff works before any database exists. The
cost is that there is no revocation list: a cookie lifted out of a browser stays
valid until it expires. `fingerprint()` exists so a revocation table can be added
later — persist only the hash, never the sealed value.

**`READINESS_SESSION_SECRET` must be set in the hosting environment.** Without it
the endpoint fails closed: Stage 1 still submits, no session is issued, no modal
appears and `/questionnaire` stays locked.

## Secure access and prefill

1. The applicant opens `/questionnaire?t=<opaque token>`.
2. The page exchanges the token for a session, then strips it from the visible
   URL with `history.replaceState`.
3. Autosave and completion authenticate with the session token only.

No name, email, organisation or answer ever appears in a URL. The token is 32
bytes of CSPRNG output, not derived from any identifier, and only its SHA-256
hash is stored.

Prefill (application id, name, work email, organisation, role, organisation type,
annual volume) is returned by the server against the verified token — never read
from the URL. It is displayed read-only in the application summary, with the work
email masked. Only BRQ-01 is editable, as section 6.2 allows; other corrections
are directed to Aurixa.

With the gate on, the form does not render without a valid session. Missing and invalid tokens
share one message so the page cannot be used to test whether an application or
email exists. Expired links, already-completed questionnaires and service
failures each get their own state.

A development-only preview (`/questionnaire?preview=1`) is guarded by
`import.meta.env.DEV`; Vite removes the branch and its fixture from production
builds (verified by grepping `dist/`). The fixture contains no real data.

## Save and resume

Answers are debounced 1.2 s and saved through the service, with one automatic
retry after 4 s. The applicant sees "Saving…", "Saved" or "Save failed —
retrying" in a polite live region. Drafts are held in memory while a request is
in flight and are never written to `localStorage`, the URL or analytics.

`responseVersion` is optimistic-concurrency control: the client sends the version
it holds and the server rejects a stale write instead of overwriting a newer
draft from another device.

Autosave only runs against an authorised session. With the token gate off there
is nothing to save to, and the page says so rather than showing "Saved".

**Cross-device resume is implemented but not yet live** — it depends on the
migration and edge function below being applied and deployed.

## Service contract

`POST {VITE_READINESS_API_URL}` (default
`{storefront functions base}/readiness-questionnaire`):

| Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `issue` | Admin only (`x-aurixa-admin-secret`). Stores the Stage 1 snapshot, revokes outstanding links and returns a new raw token once, for the transactional email. Never called by the browser. |
| `authorise` | Verifies the token, issues a 2-hour session, returns prefill, draft, questionnaire version, response version and completion state. |
| `save` | Upserts answers against a session, bumps the response version, records `readiness.started` on first response. |
| `complete` | Revalidates every active required answer server-side, freezes the response version, records `completed_at`, revokes the link and emits `readiness.completed`. |

Score, priority class and tier are Stage 3 outputs. They are not computed in the
browser and never returned by any of these actions.

## Data model

`readiness_applications`, `readiness_questionnaire_tokens`, `readiness_sessions`,
`readiness_responses`, `qualification_responses` and `readiness_events`. RLS is
enabled with **no policies** on every table, so only the service role — the edge
function — can read or write. Public references are the existing non-sequential
`AX-XXXXXXXXXX` id; everything internal is a UUID.

`qualification_responses` carries question id, answer, active flag, response
version, questionnaire version and timestamps, per section 13.2.

## Accessibility

Keyboard-only completion, `fieldset`/`legend` for every group, persistent
labels, required state in text as well as colour, field-level errors with an
error summary, focus moved to the first invalid question, focus moved to the
completion heading, `aria-current="step"` on the progress indicator, and polite
live regions for save status, section changes and ranked-order changes. The
ranked selector uses Add / Move up / Move down / Remove buttons — there is no
drag-and-drop.

## Verification

- `npm run lint` (tsc) — clean.
- `npm run build` — clean.
- `npm test` — 28 logic tests covering validation, every conditional rule, the
  max-three and ranked-five limits, mutual exclusivity, inactive-answer handling
  and the review model.
- Browser sweep at 1440, 1024, 768, 430, 390 and 320 px: no horizontal overflow
  in any section, on the review screen or on the completion screen; section
  validation, focus-to-first-error, forward/back answer retention, every
  conditional branch, review labels (no slugs), submission and completion focus.
- Access states driven through intercepted responses: invalid, expired,
  already-completed and service-unavailable, each stripping the token from the
  URL.
- Prefill, resumed draft, autosave success, autosave failure, automatic retry and
  recovery.
- Contact page regression: control styling and dropdown behaviour unchanged after
  the `FormControls` extraction.

## Outstanding before launch

- **Submission has no destination.** With no backend deployed, completing the
  questionnaire shows "not yet connected for submission" and the answers are
  lost when the tab closes. Either deploy the service below, or route Stage 2
  submissions through the existing Make.com webhook the way Stage 1 does — that
  decision has not been made.
- **Apply the migration and deploy the edge function.** Neither has been run.
- **Set `READINESS_SESSION_SECRET`** in Vercel, or the handoff cannot issue a
  session and the questionnaire stays locked for everyone.
- **Set `READINESS_ADMIN_SECRET`** in the function's environment.
- **Issue links from Stage 1.** The Make.com scenario (or `capture-lead`) must
  call the `issue` action after a Priority Access Application and put the
  returned token in the welcome email as `…/questionnaire?t=<token>`. Until that
  exists, `VITE_READINESS_QUESTIONNAIRE_URL` should stay unset so the Stage 1
  receipt keeps saying the link will be emailed.
- **Keep the server-side required rules in step** with
  `src/lib/readinessQuestionnaire.ts`; the edge function duplicates them
  deliberately so the browser is never the only check.
- **Link expiry, reissue and reminder suppression** (section 10) are supported by
  the schema but have no operational process yet.
- **`X-Robots-Tag` header** for `/questionnaire` at the hosting layer.
- **Retention and deletion jobs** for abandoned and withdrawn questionnaires
  (section 14.1).
