Build the Open Graph card and the raster app icons from the one logo source.

Two problems this solves, both of them things a link-preview scraper or a
browser tab does on every share and every page load:

**There was no `og:image`.** A link to aurixasystems.com.au pasted into
LinkedIn, Slack, WhatsApp or iMessage rendered as a bare URL. None of the
existing brand assets works as one: the Stripe logo tile is 1600x604 (2.65:1,
so it letterboxes or centre-crops against Open Graph's 1.91:1), the Stripe icon
is square (which downgrades the card to a small thumbnail), and the old
`aurixa-symbol.svg` was an SVG — no unfurler accepts SVG for `og:image`.

**The favicon was 535 KB.** `aurixa-symbol.svg` was an SVG wrapper around a
base64-encoded JPEG, and it was the tab icon, so every page load paid for it.
A 32x32 PNG is about two kilobytes. It has since been deleted outright: it was
also being used to fill a 96px square on the home page, which a 19 KB WebP does
better.

Everything derives from `brand-source/aurixa-lockup-source.png` — a PNG with a real
alpha channel, kept OUT of `public/` so the 401 KB original is never served — and reuses the
ground, glow and placement helpers from `build-stripe-brand-assets.py` so the
two sets cannot drift apart. Same reasoning as that script for putting the mark
on an opaque dark ground rather than shipping transparency: we do not control
what an unfurler or an OS composites behind it, and gold on white is the weak
case.
