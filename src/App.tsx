// ── Eager: every indexable route ─────────────────────────────────────────────
// The split below is not a guess about which pages are popular — it is exactly
// the `indexable` boundary from src/lib/routeMetadata.ts, and it has to be.
// `scripts/prerender.ts` renders these to static HTML with react-dom/server,
// and `renderToString` emits a Suspense fallback for a `lazy()` component
// rather than waiting for it. A lazily-loaded indexable page would therefore
// prerender as an empty box — the exact defect the prerender pass exists to
// fix. Keeping them eager costs about 75 KB in the entry chunk and is the
// price of every public page having real content in view-source.

/**
 * The A$1 Stripe test-fixture mirror of the price list — built only when the
 * flag is set, which it is not in production.
 *
 * `src/lib/pricing/mockCatalog.ts` hard-codes 41 Payment Links against the
 * **live** Stripe account, 42 price ids, and the account id itself. Marking the
 * route `noindex` did nothing about that: a JavaScript chunk is a static asset,
 * robots directives do not apply to it, and the entry chunk served on `/` names
 * every lazy chunk file, so the path never had to be guessed. Anyone could
 * fetch it. Low-value live payment links, publicly discoverable, are a standard
 * card-testing target — and card testing brings chargebacks and account review.
 *
 * The `lazy()` call has to sit inside the conditional rather than the `<Route>`
 * alone: a dynamic `import()` at module scope is a chunk boundary, and Rollup
 * emits the chunk even when the route using it is dead code. Written this way,
 * `import.meta.env` is substituted at build time and the whole branch — import
 * included — is eliminated. `routeMetadata.test.ts` proves it against `dist/`
 * rather than trusting it.
