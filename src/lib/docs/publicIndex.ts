/**
 * The public half of the documentation.
 *
 * Slug, title, one-line summary, group and tier badge for every section. This
 * IS bundled into the site, deliberately: it is the marketing surface and the
 * SEO surface, and it reveals nothing a visitor could not read on the pricing
 * page.
 *
 * The bodies are not here. They live in supabase/functions/_shared/docsCorpus*,
 * are filtered server-side by entitlement, and are fetched at runtime. If the
 * bodies were in this file the gate would be decorative — anyone could read a
 * paid module's documentation out of the JavaScript bundle.
 *
 * `src/lib/docs/publicIndex.test.ts` asserts this file and the corpus describe
 * the same set of sections, so the index cannot drift into advertising a
 * section the server will not serve, or omit one it will.
