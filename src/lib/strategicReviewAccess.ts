/**
 * Stage 3 admission.
 *
 * The scheduling page is not public. An applicant reaches it with the
 * application reference issued at Stage 1, and the reference is checked against
 * Aurixa's own records before the page shows anything at all.
 *
 * The check is deliberately a *server* decision. A rule evaluated in the
 * browser is not a gate — the bundle ships to the visitor, who can edit it — so
 * the page asks the "Aurixa Stage 3 Access" scenario and renders the scheduler
 * only if that answers yes. The admission policy itself is not in this file
 * either. It has two halves, each checked where its truth actually lives:
 *
 *   1. The application is live — a `Stage 3 Access (Application)` formula on
 *      the Aurixa Waitlist table, which the Airtable query filters on, so a
 *      denied application is never read back, let alone returned.
 *   2. Stage 2 is finished — a Business Readiness response exists for that
 *      Application ID. This is read from the responses table directly rather
 *      than from a rollup on the waitlist, because the rollup only counts
 *      *linked* responses and the link is written by an Airtable automation.
 *      Admission would then depend on that automation having already run, and
 *      on nobody switching it off, which is not something a gate should rest
 *      on. The response row is written by the Stage 2 scenario as the
 *      questionnaire is submitted, so it is true the moment it is true.
 *
 * Failures are deliberately indistinguishable. An unknown reference, a
 * reference belonging to a declined application and a reference belonging to
 * somebody else all come back the same way, so the page can never be used to
 * discover whether a particular application exists.
 *
 * Everything here is pure or takes its `fetch` as an argument, so the rules are
 * testable without a browser; the endpoint lives in `strategicReviewAccessClient`.
