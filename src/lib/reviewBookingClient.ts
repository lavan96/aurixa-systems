/**
 * Wires the pure booking logic to Stage 3's pipeline.
 *
 * Everything configuration- or network-shaped lives here: the endpoint and the
 * two mirrors. `reviewBooking.ts` stays free of `import.meta.env` so its rules
 * can be tested outside a bundler.
 *
 * The Stage 3 Make webhook is the transport of record, for the same reason the
 * Stage 2 webhook is: that is the pipeline the booking actually travels down —
 * the Strategic Review Bookings table, the link back to the applicant's
 * waitlist record, the gate, and the confirmation email. `capture-lead` and
 * Mission Control still receive the same payload so the operator lead console
 * is unaffected, but they run after the fact and can never change what the
 * applicant is told.
