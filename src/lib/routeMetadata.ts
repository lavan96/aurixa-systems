/**
 * The one place that decides what each route is called, how it is described,
 * and — the part that matters commercially — whether a search engine is allowed
 * to know it exists.
 *
 * Several routes on this site are deliberately unlisted rather than merely
 * unlinked: `/pricing-mock` drives A$1 fixtures against the LIVE Stripe account,
 * `/questionnaire` is reached only through a secure single-use link, and the
 * `/pricing/*` receipts carry a handoff token in the URL. Indexing any of them
 * would be a real incident, not an SEO regression.
 *
 * Three separate mechanisms have to agree about that split — the sitemap, the
 * per-page `robots` directive, and the `X-Robots-Tag` headers in `vercel.json`.
 * Keeping the decision in one table is what stops them drifting apart; a route
 * added to `App.tsx` without an entry here fails `routeMetadata.test.ts` rather
 * than quietly defaulting to indexable.
