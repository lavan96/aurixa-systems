/**
 * Mission Control lead-capture client.
 *
 * The waitlist form's primary pipeline is unchanged: Make.com webhook →
 * Airtable. After that webhook succeeds, we ALSO mirror the same payload into
 * Mission Control (fire-and-forget) so operators see the lead in the /leads
 * console and get a realtime notification the moment it comes in.
 *
 * Mission Control dedupes on (corporateEmail + submittedAt), so if the
 * Make.com scenario is also configured to forward the lead server-to-server,
 * the double delivery still lands exactly once.
 *
 * This mirror must NEVER affect the visitor's experience — failures are
 * swallowed (logged to the console only) and the submission result shown to
 * the user reflects the Make.com webhook alone.
