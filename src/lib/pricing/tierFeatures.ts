// What each tier actually includes, taken from the signed-off pricing sheet's
// own per-tier module matrices rather than written by hand.
//
// Higher tiers list only what they ADD. Repeating forty-odd inherited lines on
// every card buries the difference between the plans, which is the one thing a
// pricing page exists to make obvious — so Growth and Scale say "Everything in
// X, plus" and show only the delta.
//
// Sub-modules are kept as structured data rather than folded into the module
// name, so the card can nest them instead of rendering one unreadable
// parenthetical eighteen items long.
