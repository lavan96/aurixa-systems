/**
 * The $1 mock Stripe catalogue that /pricing-mock renders.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Testing is being initiated from the prime repo (the NPC
 * Property Dashboard) against Mission Control, and every one of those tests
 * ends at a Stripe checkout. Exercising them against the real price list means
 * moving thousands of dollars per run, so this is the same catalogue — every
 * tier, every add-on module, every top-up pack, every onboarding package —
 * reminted at A$1.00 a piece.
 *
 * ── The one thing to understand before touching this file ────────────────────
 *
 * These products live in the LIVE Stripe account (acct_1TbJPK3tNhf9apmH), not a
 * sandbox. That was a deliberate, explicitly-approved call, and it is the
 * reason for the metadata discipline below. Two consequences follow, and both
 * are load-bearing:
 *
 *   1. **The links charge real money.** A$1.00 really leaves a real card. They
 *      are test *fixtures*, not test *mode*. The page says so at the top, in
 *      the largest type on it, because somebody will eventually open this URL
 *      without reading the commit that added it.
 *
 *   2. **The namespace must never collide with the live one.** Mission
 *      Control's three sync routines resolve a product by searching Stripe
 *      metadata — `metadata['aurixa_tier']`, `metadata['aurixa_module']` and
 *      `metadata['aurixa_pack']` respectively (see stripe-catalog-sync,
 *      stripe-module-sync and stripe-pack-sync in the mission-control repo).
 *      If a mock product carried one of those keys, the next press of Apply
 *      could bind the real catalogue row to a $1 price and every customer on
 *      it would be charged a dollar. So the mocks carry `aurixa_mock_tier`,
 *      `aurixa_mock_module`, `aurixa_mock_pack` and `aurixa_mock_setup` — keys
 *      no live search will ever match — and the test in mockCatalog.test.ts
 *      asserts that no reserved key is ever reintroduced.
 *
 * Every mock also carries `aurixa_mock: "true"`, which is the single handle for
 * finding or retiring the whole set: `metadata['aurixa_mock']:'true'` in Stripe
 * search returns these 38 products and nothing else.
 *
 * ── What the mocks deliberately do NOT do ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A Payment Link purchase reaches Mission Control's webhook without the
 * `mode`/`item_id` metadata that fulfilment needs, so it raises
 * `PermanentError("missing_metadata")`: the event is recorded and stops there.
 * No plan is provisioned, no credits are issued, no module is enabled. That is
 * not a limitation of the mocks — it is exactly how the live add-on Payment
 * Links in addonPurchaseLinks.ts already behave, which is why those cards say
 * the module is enabled by the team rather than instantly. Mirroring it is the
 * point: the mock behaves like the thing it is standing in for.
