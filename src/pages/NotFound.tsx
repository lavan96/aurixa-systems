/**
 * The catch-all route.
 *
 * Before this existed an unknown path matched no `<Route>`, so `<main>` in
 * `App.tsx` rendered empty — navigation and footer present, nothing between
 * them. It read as a broken page rather than a missing one.
 *
 * There are two ways to reach a missing page, and they are served differently:
 *
 *   • **A direct hit or a refresh** never reaches this component. Every real
 *     route is a prerendered file on disk, so Vercel's filesystem check misses
 *     and serves `dist/404.html` with a genuine **HTTP 404** — the same markup
 *     as below, rendered at build time by `scripts/prerender.ts`.
 *   • **A client-side navigation** to a bad `to=` never touches the network, so
 *     there is no response whose status could be set. This component is what
 *     renders then, and it is the only case that needs it.
 *
 * The `noindex` matters for the second case and is belt-and-braces for the
 * first, which already carries the directive in its served bytes.
