// Serves the Command Center documentation, filtered to what the caller is
// entitled to read. This function exists so the filtering happens on a server:
// the corpus lives under supabase/functions/ and is never bundled into the
// site, so a locked section's body is not merely hidden in the browser — it is
// never sent.
//
// Entitlement comes from the handoff token the dashboard minted, resolved
// server-to-server against Mission Control. The token is the credential; a
// caller cannot assert a plan by editing the URL, because the plan is never
// read from the request.
//
// No token is a valid request. It returns the universal sections in full and
// every priced section locked to title and summary, which is exactly what an
// anonymous visitor to the marketing site should see.
